# ProjectMemoryBot - Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Search Functionality Crash
**Problem**: `InvalidColumnReferenceError: SELECT DISTINCT ON expressions must match initial ORDER BY expressions`

**Root Cause**: PostgreSQL requires `DISTINCT ON` expressions to match the initial `ORDER BY` expressions, but the code was using `DISTINCT ON (artifacts.id)` with `ORDER BY artifacts.created_at DESC`.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `DISTINCT ON` with subquery approach in both [app/handlers/ask.py](file://c:\Users\UraJura\project-memory-bot\app\handlers\ask.py) and [app/services/memory.py](file://c:\Users\UraJura\project-memory-bot\app\services\memory.py)
- Used proper search query parsing:
  - Numeric input → ID search
  - # prefix → tag search  
  - Otherwise → title search

### 2. Duplicate Artifacts in Source List
**Problem**: One artifact shown multiple times (one row per action: 🗑, 🏷, ✏️, 🔎)

**Root Cause**: The query was not properly deduplicating artifacts when filtering by tags.

**Solution**:
- Show one row per artifact with [➕/🧺, 🗑] buttons only
- Added duplicate removal logic using a set-based approach
- Toggle button changes icon based on selection state (➕/🧺)
- Added delete functionality with `aw:delete` callback handler

### 3. LLM Inappropriate Calls
**Problem**: LLM was being called during search operations when it shouldn't be.

**Root Cause**: Search responses were being processed by the chat handler which could trigger LLM calls.

**Solution**:
- Verified `LLM_DISABLED = os.getenv("LLM_DISABLED", "1") == "1"` defaults to disabled for tests
- Ensured LLM is only called from single point after ASK arm with proper conditions:
  - Sources must be selected
  - ASK must be armed
  - Chat must be ON
- Confirmed search functionality routes through proper ASK handlers without LLM calls

## Files Modified

### [app/handlers/ask.py](file://c:\Users\UraJura\project-memory-bot\app\handlers\ask.py)
- Fixed `_render_panel` function to use subquery approach instead of `DISTINCT ON`
- Added duplicate artifact removal logic
- Improved search query parsing in `_parse_search_query`
- Enhanced button layout with proper [➕/🧺, 🗑] per artifact
- Added `aw:delete` callback handler

### [app/services/memory.py](file://c:\Users\UraJura\project-memory-bot\app\services\memory.py)
- Fixed `list_artifacts` function to use subquery approach instead of `DISTINCT ON`
- Added missing `distinct` import

### [app/handlers/chat.py](file://c:\Users\UraJura\project-memory-bot\app\handlers\chat.py)
- Verified proper routing of search responses to ASK handlers
- Confirmed LLM calls are properly gated

### Docker Configuration
- Restarted containers to ensure all changes take effect
- Verified no errors in container logs

## Testing Verification

The bot has been tested and verified to work correctly with:

1. **Search Functionality**:
   - Enter "women" → Shows list without crashes
   - Enter #woman → Shows list without crashes  
   - Enter exact artifact ID → Returns exactly one row

2. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   - No artifact appears multiple times in lists
   - Each artifact has only two buttons [➕/🧺, 🗑]

3. **Toggle Functionality**:
   - Toggle ➕/🧺 reflects selection state correctly
   - Does not trigger LLM calls

4. **Delete Functionality**:
   - 🗑 button deletes artifacts properly
   - Does not break pagination/panel

5. **LLM Control**:
   - LLM only called when sources selected + ASK armed + chat ON
   - Search operations do not trigger LLM

## Deployment

All changes have been:
- Committed to git
- Pushed to GitHub for backup
- Deployed via Docker container restart
- Verified with clean logs (no errors or exceptions)

# Refine and Sources Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes made to address the issues with the refine action and sources back button functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Save Button Icon
**Problem**: After saving an answer, the button showed âœ… instead of ðŸ—‚
**Fix**: Updated the `answer_actions_keyboard` function to show ðŸ—‚ when an answer is saved

### 2. Sources Back Button
**Problem**: When clicking "Back" from the sources overlay, it was not returning to the original 6 action buttons and showed "no sources info available"
**Fix**: Updated the `handle_sources_back` function to properly restore the original keyboard with the correct message_id

### 3. Refine Action
**Problem**: The refine action was not properly handling new queries and was returning previous responses
**Fix**: 
1. Added new fields to the UserState model: `ask_refine_msg_id` and `ask_refine_run_id`
2. Created a database migration to add these fields
3. Updated the `handle_refine_answer` function to store the original message info
4. Implemented a proper `handle_refine_reply` function that edits the original message instead of creating a new one
5. Added logic to copy sources from the original run_id to the new run_id for refined answers

## Technical Details

### Save Button Icon Change
- Changed the save icon from âœ… to ðŸ—‚ when an answer is saved
- This provides a direct link to the saved artifact

### Sources Back Button Fix
- Fixed the `handle_sources_back` function to use the correct message_id
- Ensured proper restoration of the original keyboard with the correct saved/pinned state

### Refine Action Implementation
- Added `ask_refine_msg_id` and `ask_refine_run_id` fields to the UserState model
- Created database migration `0016_add_ask_refine_fields.py`
- Updated `handle_refine_answer` to store original message info
- Implemented `handle_refine_reply` to edit the original message
- Added logic to copy sources from original run_id to new run_id

## Files Modified

1. `app/models.py` - Added `ask_refine_msg_id` and `ask_refine_run_id` fields to UserState model
2. `app/handlers/ask.py` - Updated save icon, fixed sources back button, implemented refine action
3. `alembic/versions/0016_add_ask_refine_fields.py` - Database migration for new fields

## Testing Notes

To test the fixes:
1. After saving an answer, the save button should show ðŸ—‚ instead of âœ…
2. When clicking "Sources" and then "Back", it should return to the original 6 action buttons
3. When using the refine action, it should properly process new queries instead of returning previous responses

## Known Limitations

1. The refine action currently uses a simple approach and doesn't include the original context
2. Source opening functionality is still a placeholder
3. Cache-based state management is temporary (would be better with persistent storage)

## Future Improvements

1. Implement full context inclusion in the refine action
2. Add persistent state storage in the database
3. Enhance source opening functionality
4. Add more comprehensive logging for production debugging

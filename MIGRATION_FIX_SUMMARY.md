# Migration Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fix for the Alembic migration issue that was causing conflicts due to multiple head revisions.

## Issue
The Alembic migration system was showing an error:
```
ERROR [alembic.util.messaging] Multiple head revisions are present for given argument 'head'; please specify a specific target revision, '<branchname>@head' to narrow to a specific head, or 'heads' for all heads
```

## Root Cause
There were two migrations that both had the same `down_revision` (`0015`):
1. `e9a91e3bdfb2_add_ask_prompt_msg_id_field.py` - Added the `ask_prompt_msg_id` field
2. `0016_add_ask_refine_fields.py` - Added the `ask_refine_msg_id` and `ask_refine_run_id` fields

This created a branchpoint where both migrations were trying to be applied after the same revision, resulting in multiple head revisions.

## Solution
Updated the `0016_add_ask_refine_fields.py` migration file to depend on `e9a91e3bdfb2` instead of `0015`:
- Changed `down_revision = '0015'` to `down_revision = 'e9a91e3bdfb2'`

This creates a linear migration chain:
`0015 -> e9a91e3bdfb2 -> 0016`

## Files Modified
1. `alembic/versions/0016_add_ask_refine_fields.py` - Updated `down_revision` to point to the correct previous migration

## Verification
After the fix, the migrations were successfully applied:
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade e9a91e3bdfb2 -> 0016, add ask_refine_msg_id and ask_refine_run_id fields
```

The current migration status shows a single head revision:
```
0016 (head)
```

## Future Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always check the current migration history before creating new migrations
2. Ensure new migrations depend on the actual latest migration, not a previous one
3. Use `alembic branches` and `alembic history` commands to verify the migration chain
